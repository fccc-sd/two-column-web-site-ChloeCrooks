                    <p>Foxes are small-to-medium sized omnivorous mammals. They have flattened skulls 
                    with upright, triangular ears with a pointed, slightly upturned snout with long 
                    busy tails. A group of foxes are referred to as a <em>skulk, leash, or 
                    earth.</em></p>
                    <p>Fox species have different fur color, length, and density. The coat colors may range from a
                        pearly white to black-and-white to black flecked with white or gray on the underside. For example,
                        Arctic Foxes have tiny ears and short limbs with thick, insulating fur, that helps keep their bodies
                         warm to help keep them warm in the cold while Fennex Foxes have large ears as well as short fur 
                         to help keep their bodies cool.
                    </p>
                    <p>When in the wild, the typical lifespan of a fox is onew to three years old, though some may live
                        up to ten years. Unlike many candids, foxes are not always pack animals. They normally live in
                        small family groups, but some like to be solitary.
                    </p>
                    <p>Foxes are omnivores, their diet is primarily made up of sinvertebrates which are insects and small
                        vertebrate such as reptiles and birds. They may also eat eggs and vegetation. Many foxes are 
                        generalist predators but some have a more specialized diets. Most foxes consume abound 2.2 lb
                        of food everyday. Foxes will cache excess food will bury it for later consumption or under
                        leaves, snow, or soil.
